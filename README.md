# MVC-CompanyDrill
This Git repository contains a company project developed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The project focuses on managing various components such as Employees, Departments, Roles, and Users.

The project follows a three-tier architecture, consisting of the Business Logic Layer (BLL), Data Access Layer (DAL), and Presentation Layer (PL).

The BLL handles the business logic and rules of the application, including processing and manipulating data related to employees, departments, roles, and users. It ensures the integrity and consistency of the data.

The DAL provides an interface to interact with the database, allowing the application to retrieve, store, and update information related to the project's models. It abstracts the underlying data storage mechanisms and provides a unified access point.

The PL focuses on the user interface and user interactions. It provides the necessary views and controllers to present the data and handle user input. The PL communicates with the BLL to perform actions and retrieve information.

Overall, this project employs the MVC pattern and a three-tier architecture to create a modular and maintainable application for managing employees, departments, roles, and users within a company setting.
